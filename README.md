# Kahoot-Answer-API

## If you want to use the script I made using the api, run 'Main.py' or install the .exe which has been compiled so you don't need to install python

## ❓How To Use❓
You can either use `KahootClass.py` to use the class for yourself
or you can run `Main.py` where the code has been written already.
Firstly, you need the quizId (not the game pin).
To get the quizId, look up at the host's screen and look at the link,
at the end it will say 'quizId=(quizId is here)'.
