# Kahoot-Answer-API

## If you want to use the script I made using the api, run 'Main.py' or install the .exe which has been compiled so you don't need to install python

## ❓How To Use❓
Firstly, you need the quizId (not the game pin).
To get the quizId, look up at the host's screen and look at the link,
at the end it will say 'quizId=(quizId is here)'.
Make an instance of the Kahoot class and pass in the quizId as the param.

## ❓Don't want to write this all by yourself?❓
Just run the 'how_to_use.py' file.
It will prompt you to enter the quizId.
Once you put it in and press enter, it will print out the answers.
